The Syllable series is organized by Julia Pistell and Brett.
The reading was at Little River Restoratives in Hartford, CT.

Sonya Huber:
Suffers from rheumatoid arthritis, although only in her 40s.
Read an essay about chronic pain.
Also another essay about how her condition makes her
skin/body *permeable* to the environment.
The polluted environment--due to smoke/exhaust and chemicals--
lead to pain.

Kem Joy Ukwu:
Read two short stories. From New Jersey.

Lauren Bolstridge:
Played some acoustic/folk songs.
From West Hartford and lives in the area, I think.

I talked to Susan Dunne, the Arts Writer from the Hartford Courant
(``sdunne@courant.com``).
I sent her the text of the poems I read.

I hung out and talked to some people in the art scene who are
friends with Brett.

Namulen works at Real Art Ways (RAW). I'm not sure if she is an artist.
She suggested going to the Creative Cocktail Hour event at RAW,
in paricular the 15th anniversary on November 16.

Alexis is some kind of artist, who is having a show at Artspace Hartford.
She has a nosering.

Adrian is a photographer (specializing in black and white, darkroom photos).
He had an accident so has been living with his parents in Enfield, CT.
Namulen is subletting his place in the West End of Hartford.
He says that the Hartford arts scene is really supportive.

Where: Molasses Books in Brooklyn, NY
Why: ?
Other readers: Sarah Jean Alexander, Jonathan Aprea, Connor Messinger,
others who I forgot

I smoked a little weed before at Sarah Jean Alexander/Stephen Tully
Dierks/Andrew Worthington/Maggie Lee's apartment in Bed Stuy. Me and
Sarah took the bus to Molasses Books in Bushwick. It was a single room
bookstore/coffeeshop/bar. The readers were Jonathan Aprea, Connor
Messinger, SJA, me, and others.

People read sort of quietly and I tried to read loudly. I think I read
alright. I was sort of nervous.

Jonathan Aprea had a line about how at the (magnetic) north pole, there
is no north, and every direction is south. Then he had a line about how
at the center of a condominium, there is no condominium. I told him I
liked that line. He said he liked my reading.

We went to a bar (Tutu's) near Mellow Pages after. We ate and people
drank then everyone left. Back at the apartment in SJ's bed, me and her
stopped seeing each other.

Where: Housing Works in Manhattan, NY
Why: Release of Mira Gonzalez's book
*i will never be beautiful enough to make us beautiful together*
Other readers: Mira Gonzalez, Spencer Madesen, Giancarlo DiTrapano,
Kool AD (Victor Vazquez)

I read these at Mira Gonzalez's book release party at Housing Works in
Manhattan. Mira, Spencer Madsen, Giancarlo DiTrapano, and Kool AD read.
I work a polo shirt and a hoodie. I took Xanax and a couple codeine
seltzer pills (from Europe), but I didn't drink. I was kind of spaced
out and didn't talk much to people. I took the train home and worked the
next afternoon.

Where: apartment in Brooklyn, NY
Why: *Keep This Bag Away from Children* release
Other readers: Jordan Castro, David Fishkind, Mallory Whittan,
Andrew Worthington

I read these at a Keep This Bag Away From Children reading in October
2012. Jordan Casto read and played a few songs. David Fishkind and
Mallory Whittan read. I think Andrew Worthington read. Megan Boyle, Tao
Lin, and Brandon Scott Gorrell were there. BSG told me I did good. I
didn't take any drugs. I think I went home on the train.

[We went to an after party at Tao's friend's place. Tao, Mallory, Megan,
Jordan, David, BSG all went into a room at the place and hung out by
themselves. They kept the door closed. Ed Halladay was pissed because he
set up the reading. In Portland, "everyone hangs out with everyone"
after the show.

I had made plans to split a cab with David. I had to knock on the VIP
door and ask to talk to David. David said he was gonna stay for a while
and I should just go by myself.]

Where: Coffee shop called Linger in Brooklyn, NY.
Why: ?
Other readers: Spencer Madsen, Maggie Lee, Elaine Sun,
Steve Roggenbuck, Poncho Peligroso

[This was my first reading in New York City.]

I read these at a reading in the Linger coffee shop in Brooklyn with
Spencer Madsen, Maggie Lee, Elaine Sun, Steve Roggenbuck, Poncho
Peligroso. I wore a button up shirt, tucked in, and nice black pants. I
took Xanax in the bathroom and drank a couple beers before the reading.
I read poems from [my book] *Santo Del Supermercado*. I was nervous but did alright.

[Poncho read tweets from the recently passed Tree\_bro.]

Megan Boyle was there. I don't remember if she read. I arm wrestled
Spencer. I met his brother Tyler for the first time.

I drank more after and blacked out eventually. We went to someone's
apartment. I slept on Spencer's rug on the floor of his tiny apartment
room (in Boerem Hill?). Spencer and Maggie slept in his twin bed. That
was the first time they had sort of got together.

Melissa Broder was there. She emailed me after and asked for me to send
her some poems I had read. She gave me a critique.

----------

Where: the RowHouse Restaurant in Topeka, KS
Why: Release of issue of *seveneightfive* magazine?
Other readers: Mickey Caeser, ?

This was the first proper reading I did. I read under the psuedonym
Zeke Collyer.

I was invited by the editor of the local *seveneightfive* magazine, after he had
published some of my poems. He was a former student of Brian Daldorph,
I believe, who was a poetry professor at the University of Kansas.
I had taken a class taught by Prof. Daldorph and he had invited the class
to submit to the magazine.

My parents attended. I read poems about masturbation, etc.
