:slug: surname

My surname is *Mallicoat*, pronounced like the first two syllables of
*malady* followed by the ordinary word *coat*.

The *Dictionary of American Family Names* [#DAFM]_ has these two
relevant entries:

    Malicoat (250) English: unexplained. Compare MALLICOAT.

    Mallicoat (240) English: unexplained. Compare MALICOAT.

It is an uncommon name. The numbers given (250 and 240) are the
frequency of the surname in the "sample of 88.7 million listings in the
[Dictionary of American Family Names] database." For comparison, the
frequency of *Newman* is 39,339.

Oldtimers in my family have done some genealogical work, concluding
(per my father) that *Mallicoat* is a "habitational name from a place
so named in Devon county, England." The supposed place is the village
of Mullacott_, near Ilfracombe. The village appears in the `Domesday
Book`_ of 1086 as *Molecote*.

All of the American Mallicoats are apprently descended from one John Mallicote,
who was born ca. 1616–1660 in England and died ca. 1657–1740 in the Colony of
Virginia.

A Jamaican cable man, when installing a modem at my apartment long ago,
told me that there are Mallicoats in Jamaica, too.
