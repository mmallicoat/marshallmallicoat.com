Movies I like
=============

*The Thing* (1982)
------------------
Sort of a `"bottle movie"`_ set at an Antartic research station,
where an alien organism is thawed out of the ice and infects
the personel there.
I like the dark and cold of the place, the closeness and paranoia.
The setting reminds me of Lovecraft's "At the Mountains of Madness"
or the Antartic scenes from the 1998 X-Files movie.
The look of the monsters is pretty cool.

*The Rocky Horror Picture Show* (1975)
--------------------------------------
During one of the songs, there is a short cut of Magenta and Columbia
having what looks like to be a slumber partyâ€”one of them in a
Mickey Mouse hat.

I like the dinner scene where they are eating Eddie (played by Meat Loaf).

I like the songs, especially the ending sequence in the swimming pool
and after Riff Raff and Megenta kill or turn everyone to stone.

*Blade Runner* (1982)
---------------------
I like the scenery: the rain and smoke and neon signs.
I like Deckard's dingy apartment.
I like watching Harrison Ford eat noodles.
I like all of the detective stuff.

The fighting with the androids is tedious.
The romance between Deckard and Rachael is nonsensical.
The movie as a whole is maybe incoherent and too long.

*Der Baader Meinhof Komplex* (2008)
-----------------------------------
This is a German movie about the `Red Army Faction`_.
I was fascinated by this movie when I first saw it
and rewatched it a number of times.
I saw it around the time I was reading Derrick Jensen's `*Endgame*`_
and was struck by the possibility, and even moral inevitability,
of direct resistance against systems that seem unassailable
and omnipresent.

There are fragments of dialogue from this movie
that resonate with me, though I can't quite understand why
they are significant.

- When Gudrun, in frustration with the military exercises
  they are being taught at the PLO camp, explains
  (in German-accented English) "We are urban guerilla".
- When XXX, after being shot by an assassin,
  takes off his shoe, removes his watch, kisses it,
  saying "I am dead; let me live." as if a magical formula.
- When Baader's car is stolen and he screams in the
  streets of Sicily, "Vas!"

This movie is ostensively about a failed revolutionary
movement. But maybe it is also about martyrdom.
