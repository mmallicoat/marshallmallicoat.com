Webster's Dictionary [#Websters]_ lists many different types of
carriages among its entries. Strangely, it seems to me, most of these
are accompanied with illustrations. These always catch my eye as I
look up words, so I've gradually become aware of the great diversity
in the construction of these vehicles. For no reason other than to
scratch an itch, I've collected a list of different types of carriages
and wagons here. Unless otherwise noted, I believe I found them in
Webster's.
