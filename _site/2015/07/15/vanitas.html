	<p><strong>Grave Plots</strong></p>

<p>My parents came into a couple grave plots. (I don&rsquo;t know how.) They&rsquo;re trying to flip them, since they already have spots reserved. They say that the cemetery in question isn&rsquo;t as desirable as it used to be, so they want to unload them fast. Especially since cremation is getting more popular.</p>

<p>My mom on cremation: <em>You don&rsquo;t amount to much.</em> Just a two-pint Ziploc. She dumped her mother&rsquo;s ashes illegally off the Pacific coast, by where the <em>Twilight</em> movies were shot. The remainder was pressed into a bead that she keeps on her Pandora bracelet. (This one aside, she has about $1300 in charms on it.)</p>

<p><strong>Notice</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve come to understand the things I&rsquo;ve left at my parents&rsquo; house, since moving out, as <em>horcruxes.</em> I&rsquo;ll keep them there safe&mdash;my old t-shirts and books&mdash;in case I&rsquo;m cut down in the street. (Tho if I was hit by a car tomorrow, this and everything else on my computer would be lost forever.)</p>

<p>This month I had to delete the first dead person from my email contacts: an old boss, aged 66, a Marlboro man. Put into the bin and then the bin emptied.</p>

<p>I received a Google Alert when my grandfather&rsquo;s Obits4Life page went live, since I was listed among the bereft. My inheritance remains obscure. It&rsquo;s like I was left a set of shoe trees, but threw them out, not knowing what they were for.</p>

<p><strong>Old Man Mallicoat</strong></p>

<p>I plan to bald gracefully. I&rsquo;ll keep it real short and see if I can slide by for a couple decades. If it gets too bad, I&rsquo;ll shave it all off and be done with it.</p>

<p>My eye doctor says that, if I keep using computers, my eyes will slowly get worse and worse forever.</p>

<p>My dentist says that I grind my teeth in my sleep, probly due to my stress. So now I go to sleep in shorts and a mouthguard like a boxer.</p>

<p>After a weekend in the city, I&rsquo;ll have black snot and my fingers will be swollen red around the nail. I feel like my body is already rotting. Like I&rsquo;m being fitted for the big &amp; tall in the sky.</p>

<p>For my wake, lay me out on a California king. Run my obituary in the <em>Kansas City Star</em>, my preferred newspaper of record.</p>

<p><strong>Vanity</strong></p>

<p>My desk dictionary memorializes Christopher Columbus as thus: <em>1451-1506 Ital. navigator; disc. Am.</em> I doubt my legacy will be abbreviated so succinctly.</p>

<p>They think Los Angeles will been underwater in 100 years. I estimate I&rsquo;ve eaten 4800 peanut butter sandwiches in my lifetime.</p>

<p>Bell peppers change color from green to yellow or orange and then to red. I suspect this is the original metaphor for traffic lights.</p>

<p>Implicit in everything I write here is the assumption that the world has never ended. Now that it’s been said, I don’t know why that seemed like such a statement to make.</p>
