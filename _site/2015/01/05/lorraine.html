	<h1 class="title">My brief roommate</h1>
	<p>Her name is Lorraine, like the motel where Martin Luther King was shot.</p>

<p>Long tangled hair, grey-brown. Bad teeth. 52 and haggard.</p>

<p>The kind of woman who coughs and hacks and spits in the morning.</p>

<p>Her diet: milk, whitebread, mayonnaise, corn, canned tuna, boiled hotdogs, hamburger buns, instant decaf coffee.</p>

<p>Calls me Marshall or Matthew or Michael and, only once, Raymond.</p>

<p>Frequently offers me food, which I decline.
</br>&#8226; Fruit snacks (“They got Vitamin C.”)
</br>&#8226; Coca-Cola (“It&rsquo;s fresh!”)
</br>&#8226; Crackers (“Whole wheat.”)
</br>&#8226; Chicken giblets (“They&rsquo;re tough. They&rsquo;ll make you strong!”)</p>

<p>Has one of those plastic pill trays with compartments for MORN, NOON, EVE, and BED.</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t have a phone or a computer. The woman who keeps her money was supposed to set her up with a TV and a cellphone but hasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Her friends generally get her attention by standing in front of the building and yelling her name.</p>

<p>In the neighborhood where we live, there are wild roaming chihuahuas.</p>

<p>Used to work sweeping floors, but now no longer works.</p>

<p>Asks me a few times a day for 50 cents, to buy loosies from the corner store. We keep a running tab. I promised myself I wouldn&rsquo;t give her more than $5, but eventually she wore me down. She&rsquo;ll have money for me on the first of the month.</p>

<p>Has a boyfriend, who is apparently French and a carpenter. Sometimes she helps him in some capacity, for which he pays her in McDonald&rsquo;s. He also lets her wash her pissy clothes at his place.</p>

<p>Asked me to buy cocaine for her once, but I said no.</p>

<p>Some things she says:
</br>&#8226; “Oh, yeeaahh?” (face scrunches up like a chipmunk)
</br>&#8226; “Wooow” (breathless awe; can be said after any statement, e.g. <em>L: “Do you have a car?” M: &ldquo;Yeah.” L: “Wooow. What color is it?” M: “Green.” L: “Wooow.”</em>)
</br>&#8226; “Can I borrow fifty cents, baby?”</p>

<p>Is somewhat pleasant to talk to, considering.</p>

<p>Smoked inside the apartment until I told her to stop, then continues to smoke inside when I&rsquo;m not around. Uses a little crystal swan as an ashtray.</p>

<p>Brought a stray cat into the apartment. I made her kick it out, but she still lays out little dishes on the floor for it.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s milk souring somewhere where I can&rsquo;t find.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if she has the cat hidden away somewhere or if she is keeping an imaginary cat.</p>

<p>I have since moved out.</p>
