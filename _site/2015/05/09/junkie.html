	<h1 class="title">Junkie, don't talk to me</h1>
	<p><strong>Cold water after black coffee is like tempering steel</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve come to a calm in the midst of my mid-morning coffee&mdash;my first and only coffee of the day. The fog in my head burns off. The wool-legged spiders who cobweb my attic disperse.</p>

<p>Caffeine doesn&rsquo;t bring euphoria&mdash;more like an elasticity to your limbs and a humming in your head, from the amplified sound of your blood. And a feeling like being wrapped in warm, clean towels.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s only good for the first few sips. Just as you start to enjoy the high, you&rsquo;ve already peaked. By the time you finish, you&rsquo;re past the plateau and down in the valley after.</p>

<p>Nowadays I&rsquo;m only happy for 15 minutes at a time, followed by a headache. And with it comes boredom. Not a boredom like watching paint dry, but watching paint that had recently dried. The grass growing in the lawn has stalled out, and I&rsquo;m languishing in a terminal middle-class lifestyle.</p>

<p><strong>Taking dexedrine at 2am in NYC to hold you thru till 5am when Grand Central re-opens and you can get a train back to Connecticut</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;d say, if caffeine was a taxi conducting your body thru the human traffic, that dexedrine is a black sedan speeding thru a tunnel at night.</p>

<p><strong>Junkie</strong></p>

<p>I can tell when my mom has been drinking coffee. She is jubilant. She is effervescent. She <em>bubbles</em>. I tell her, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me, junkie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She started drinking coffee because she was narcoleptic and would fall asleep while driving. I only started drinking coffee after I started taking caffeine pills. Which I only took with alcohol, to make drinking less miserable.</p>

<p>I read an insightful observation somewhere, maybe in a Gawker comment, that Lindsay Lohan wasn&rsquo;t a cokehead, just an alcoholic who took cocaine to be able to drink more.</p>

<p><strong>Coffee as ideology</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>You&rsquo;re in the city and there&rsquo;s coffee to buy. Either with brunch or after when you walk around the shops. Later there&rsquo;s beer. Someone&rsquo;s in town for a few days or it&rsquo;s a going away party. You drink and talk and make plans to meet at the new brunch place in the morning. They have the best espresso.</p></li>
<li><p>The pass code for the bathroom at the Union Square Starbucks on July 4, 2014 was 8282. And I gave it away to the first person I saw: a Russian tourist standing in line. In turn, she gave it to the people behind her. In this way, she was my first apostle.</p></li>
<li><p>I prefer the discretion of pill poppers and day drunks to the perverts who go to cafes after dark.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Hairy Man</strong></p>

<p>In the March 2014 issue of <em>The Red Bulletin</em>, an interview with Nicolas Cage (“Being Nicolas Cage”) opens with “Do you think about death?” (He does.)</p>

<p>At the grocery store by the energy drinks, there is a sign that says &ldquo;This area is monitored by Closed Circuit Television.&rdquo; In the aisle by the safety razors, the same sign, plus a sliding plastic shield across the shelf&mdash;presumably to slow you down when scooping them into your trash bag.</p>

<p>The implication is that there exists a cohort of congenitally hairy men (or one Hairy Man) who both fiends for caffeine and is willing to do anything to alleviate his condition.</p>
