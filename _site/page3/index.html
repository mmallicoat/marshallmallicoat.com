		<p><strong>Golf</strong></p>

<p>The inner workings of a miniature golf course amount to a secret gospel.</p>

<p>Miniature golf is to golf what reality TV is to reality.</p>

<p>In golf, you swing lowercase L&rsquo;s at the tops of semicolons.</p>

<p>At the bowling alley, they give you golf pencils to keep score.</p>

<p>My grandfather owned both a set of clubs and a bowling ball. My father has neither.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve invented a new drink that&rsquo;s half-Arnold Palmer and half-Shirley Temple, called the LBJ.</p>

<p>Guessing a woman&rsquo;s age is a kind of golf.</p>

<p><strong>Other Sports</strong></p>

<p>Baseball is basically unwatchable, but it works on the radio.</p>

<p>The counter-insurgency is Whac-a-Mole, the drug war Three-card Monte.</p>

<p>Capitalism has wrought the moneyballing of everything. The Dutch work 6 hours a day, then ride bikes home. Americans work for 6 hours, spend 2 hours on Facebook, then crawl thru traffic for 45 minutes.</p>

<p>Someone who sits very still at a desk all day, looking at small numbers on a screen, is a kind of athlete. It takes endurance. You need training and preparation to do it without hurting yourself. These are grown men with all the hair rubbed off their ankles by socks and prostates the size of clenched fists. They will show you their game face.</p>

<p>The highest compliment you can pay a man is to call him a machine. Men strive to make themselves into weapons. This is done thru emotional distance, rituals of control, and repetition.</p>

<p><strong>On Sportsmanship</strong>    </p>

<p>I was a high school wrestler for one day. I was on the swimming team but quit. After failing to induce vomiting in the bathroom, I lied about having vomited to get out of practice. At a strip mall dojo, I put my fist thru the drywall.</p>

<p>In job interviews, I extemporize on my temperament as if I were a race horse. As long as they let me down easy, I don&rsquo;t care if I don&rsquo;t get a call back. To be listed among the also-rans is enough for me. I&rsquo;m like a retired greyhound who&rsquo;s too skinny to lie down on hardwood floors. I understand back pain&ndash;what I lack is <em>context</em> for my back pain.</p>

<p>I saw a picture of the man with the biggest hands in the world, posing with a basketball. But he doesn&rsquo;t even play basketball. He just holds it for photographs. It&rsquo;s like that guy who says he&rsquo;s crazy about football, only he never watches the games, doesn&rsquo;t know the rules, it just pops into his mind every once in a while.</p>

		</h1>
		<p>The telegraph was an early internet, with its own lolcats and leetspeak. To people in the future, we probly seem like steampunks: one foot in the last century, carrying our brains around in our pockets like Tamagotchis.</p>

<p>To open a file on your computer, you touch an arrowhead to a tiny picture of a manila folder. When you want to save, an artist&rsquo;s rendering of a 3.5” floppy disk. Clicking on a trashcan will de-index a block of memory. If the world was Tetris, we&rsquo;d all have roofs with holes in them (or no roofs at all). </p>

<p>Buddhist prayers wheels have a mantra written around so that, when spun, it is like the mantra is being read. The Dalai Lama has said that having the mantra on your computer works the same as a traditional wheel. As the digital image spins on your hard drive, it sends the peaceful prayer of compassion in all directions.</p>

<p>The Malaysian space agency recommends that Muslim astronauts, if they cannot determine the direction of Mecca, pray in the direction of the Earth. Failing that, any direction is acceptable. Additionally they advise you to &ldquo;observe peace with other beings&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In Tibet and Nepal, they still practice sky burials, where bodies are stripped and laid out for the vultures to eat. But the bodies that have been given medicine or cleaned in hospitals make the vultures sick, so they have to be buried in the ground.</p>

<p>Apparently the most coveted donors for knee replacements are Muslim men. Their patella are kept flexible by the years of praying on their knees.</p>

<p>There have never been middle-aged rappers before. And you can&rsquo;t even make a rapper admit to rapping anymore. They&rsquo;ve become demure. </p>

<p>I remember when pay phones cost 35 cents. I remember pay phones. I asked around and confirmed that they don&rsquo;t even play beer pong with beer in the cups anymore. They just keep score on paper. We will be among the last people on Earth to remember before the Internet, if yet we still do.</p>

			<a href="/2015/01/05/lorraine.html">My brief roommate</a>
		</h1>
		<p>Her name is Lorraine, like the motel where Martin Luther King was shot.</p>

<p>Long tangled hair, grey-brown. Bad teeth. 52 and haggard.</p>

<p>The kind of woman who coughs and hacks and spits in the morning.</p>

<p>Her diet: milk, whitebread, mayonnaise, corn, canned tuna, boiled hotdogs, hamburger buns, instant decaf coffee.</p>

<p>Calls me Marshall or Matthew or Michael and, only once, Raymond.</p>

<p>Frequently offers me food, which I decline.
</br>&#8226; Fruit snacks (“They got Vitamin C.”)
</br>&#8226; Coca-Cola (“It&rsquo;s fresh!”)
</br>&#8226; Crackers (“Whole wheat.”)
</br>&#8226; Chicken giblets (“They&rsquo;re tough. They&rsquo;ll make you strong!”)</p>

<p>Has one of those plastic pill trays with compartments for MORN, NOON, EVE, and BED.</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t have a phone or a computer. The woman who keeps her money was supposed to set her up with a TV and a cellphone but hasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Her friends generally get her attention by standing in front of the building and yelling her name.</p>

<p>In the neighborhood where we live, there are wild roaming chihuahuas.</p>

<p>Used to work sweeping floors, but now no longer works.</p>

<p>Asks me a few times a day for 50 cents, to buy loosies from the corner store. We keep a running tab. I promised myself I wouldn&rsquo;t give her more than $5, but eventually she wore me down. She&rsquo;ll have money for me on the first of the month.</p>

<p>Has a boyfriend, who is apparently French and a carpenter. Sometimes she helps him in some capacity, for which he pays her in McDonald&rsquo;s. He also lets her wash her pissy clothes at his place.</p>

<p>Asked me to buy cocaine for her once, but I said no.</p>

<p>Some things she says:
</br>&#8226; “Oh, yeeaahh?” (face scrunches up like a chipmunk)
</br>&#8226; “Wooow” (breathless awe; can be said after any statement, e.g. <em>L: “Do you have a car?” M: &ldquo;Yeah.” L: “Wooow. What color is it?” M: “Green.” L: “Wooow.”</em>)
</br>&#8226; “Can I borrow fifty cents, baby?”</p>

<p>Is somewhat pleasant to talk to, considering.</p>

<p>Smoked inside the apartment until I told her to stop, then continues to smoke inside when I&rsquo;m not around. Uses a little crystal swan as an ashtray.</p>

<p>Brought a stray cat into the apartment. I made her kick it out, but she still lays out little dishes on the floor for it.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s milk souring somewhere where I can&rsquo;t find.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if she has the cat hidden away somewhere or if she is keeping an imaginary cat.</p>

<p>I have since moved out.</p>
