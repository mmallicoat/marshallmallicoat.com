		<p><strong>Grave Plots</strong></p>

<p>My parents came into a couple grave plots. (I don&rsquo;t know how.) They&rsquo;re trying to flip them, since they already have spots reserved. They say that the cemetery in question isn&rsquo;t as desirable as it used to be, so they want to unload them fast. Especially since cremation is getting more popular.</p>

<p>My mom on cremation: <em>You don&rsquo;t amount to much.</em> Just a two-pint Ziploc. She dumped her mother&rsquo;s ashes illegally off the Pacific coast, by where the <em>Twilight</em> movies were shot. The remainder was pressed into a bead that she keeps on her Pandora bracelet. (This one aside, she has about $1300 in charms on it.)</p>

<p><strong>Notice</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve come to understand the things I&rsquo;ve left at my parents&rsquo; house, since moving out, as <em>horcruxes.</em> I&rsquo;ll keep them there safe&mdash;my old t-shirts and books&mdash;in case I&rsquo;m cut down in the street. (Tho if I was hit by a car tomorrow, this and everything else on my computer would be lost forever.)</p>

<p>This month I had to delete the first dead person from my email contacts: an old boss, aged 66, a Marlboro man. Put into the bin and then the bin emptied.</p>

<p>I received a Google Alert when my grandfather&rsquo;s Obits4Life page went live, since I was listed among the bereft. My inheritance remains obscure. It&rsquo;s like I was left a set of shoe trees, but threw them out, not knowing what they were for.</p>

<p><strong>Old Man Mallicoat</strong></p>

<p>I plan to bald gracefully. I&rsquo;ll keep it real short and see if I can slide by for a couple decades. If it gets too bad, I&rsquo;ll shave it all off and be done with it.</p>

<p>My eye doctor says that, if I keep using computers, my eyes will slowly get worse and worse forever.</p>

<p>My dentist says that I grind my teeth in my sleep, probly due to my stress. So now I go to sleep in shorts and a mouthguard like a boxer.</p>

<p>After a weekend in the city, I&rsquo;ll have black snot and my fingers will be swollen red around the nail. I feel like my body is already rotting. Like I&rsquo;m being fitted for the big &amp; tall in the sky.</p>

<p>For my wake, lay me out on a California king. Run my obituary in the <em>Kansas City Star</em>, my preferred newspaper of record.</p>

<p><strong>Vanity</strong></p>

<p>My desk dictionary memorializes Christopher Columbus as thus: <em>1451-1506 Ital. navigator; disc. Am.</em> I doubt my legacy will be abbreviated so succinctly.</p>

<p>They think Los Angeles will been underwater in 100 years. I estimate I&rsquo;ve eaten 4800 peanut butter sandwiches in my lifetime.</p>

<p>Bell peppers change color from green to yellow or orange and then to red. I suspect this is the original metaphor for traffic lights.</p>

<p>Implicit in everything I write here is the assumption that the world has never ended. Now that it’s been said, I don’t know why that seemed like such a statement to make.</p>

		<p><strong>Emails from your boss, written in the form of a question, with a period at the end</strong></p>

<p>Smart people are house slaves to the rich. Even among the aliens, the Nordic whites rule over the little greens and grays. To my landlord, I am an encumbrance on the property. To my employer, a capital outlay. I find it hard to believe that, in three million years of fossil record, there is not a single lizard man.</p>

<p>Some open questions: Why does the cable company need my Social Security number? Why does my boss need to know my credit score? How come I can&rsquo;t give <em>him</em> a piss test? Where do cows get their calcium, if they only eat grass? And their protein, for that matter?</p>

<p>Spy satellites are so high up, they always look straight down. If you face forward, they can only see the top of your head.</p>

<p>I found a spot behind the security desk at the mall where I can watch the guards idly browse the internet.</p>

<p><strong>John Henry</strong></p>

<p>To survive in white collar labor, you must cultivate a certain lassitude, and wear it as a suit of armor. If the work load is heavy, you have to drag your feet, since even if you finish early you won&rsquo;t get sent home. If the work load is light, you have to pretend to be working hard or you will get assigned more work. In any case, you must also appear to be having a good time.</p>

<p>When the railroads were built, work songs were sung to set the pace of labor. It kept everyone working at a level of exertion that could be kept up all day in the hot sun without risking death. It also kept every working at the same rate, so no one could foolishly work harder to win the graces of the foreman&mdash;which would force everyone else to work harder, and thereby endanger both their welfare and their lives.</p>

<p>In the office, there&rsquo;s no sound other than the dull hum of the air conditioner and the cricketsong of computers. And your coworkers are all blood doping&mdash;cranking on the commute, then drinking themselves to sleep at night. How can you keep up without joining in?</p>

<p>John Henry was able to beat the steel-driving machine thru sheer effort. But afterward, his heart gave out and he soon died. The &ldquo;Ballad of John Henry&rdquo; says “That old hammer killed John Henry / but that old hammer won&rsquo;t kill me”. I&rsquo;m saying, that old hammer won&rsquo;t kill me.</p>

<p><strong>Not an apartment, but a dark hole I lived in for 3 years</strong></p>

<p>To vacate an apartment without incident feels like getting away with a crime. You drag your mattress down the stairwell and leave it in a dumpster like a warm body. Having recouped the full deposit, you skip town before the landlord gets wise.</p>

<p>To live is to be in constant fear of legal retribution: speeding, jaywalking, illegal downloading, cheating on your taxes, and so on. The state of Connecticut defines “loitering” as: standing around, moving slowly about, spending time idly, sauntering, dallying, lingering, or lagging behind. In Florida, twenty grams is a felony.</p>

<p>Say you found a pair of crystal antlers. How could you explain having a pair of crystal antlers to the police? Better to play it safe and quickly dispose of them.</p>

<p>Whenever you hear sirens, you think it&rsquo;s for you. When you see a cop, you think &ldquo;so this is how it ends&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before the black helicopters swoop down to snatch you up. As for me, I know my last days will be described as <em>brazen</em>.</p>

		</h1>
		<p><strong>Cold water after black coffee is like tempering steel</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve come to a calm in the midst of my mid-morning coffee&mdash;my first and only coffee of the day. The fog in my head burns off. The wool-legged spiders who cobweb my attic disperse.</p>

<p>Caffeine doesn&rsquo;t bring euphoria&mdash;more like an elasticity to your limbs and a humming in your head, from the amplified sound of your blood. And a feeling like being wrapped in warm, clean towels.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s only good for the first few sips. Just as you start to enjoy the high, you&rsquo;ve already peaked. By the time you finish, you&rsquo;re past the plateau and down in the valley after.</p>

<p>Nowadays I&rsquo;m only happy for 15 minutes at a time, followed by a headache. And with it comes boredom. Not a boredom like watching paint dry, but watching paint that had recently dried. The grass growing in the lawn has stalled out, and I&rsquo;m languishing in a terminal middle-class lifestyle.</p>

<p><strong>Taking dexedrine at 2am in NYC to hold you thru till 5am when Grand Central re-opens and you can get a train back to Connecticut</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;d say, if caffeine was a taxi conducting your body thru the human traffic, that dexedrine is a black sedan speeding thru a tunnel at night.</p>

<p><strong>Junkie</strong></p>

<p>I can tell when my mom has been drinking coffee. She is jubilant. She is effervescent. She <em>bubbles</em>. I tell her, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me, junkie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She started drinking coffee because she was narcoleptic and would fall asleep while driving. I only started drinking coffee after I started taking caffeine pills. Which I only took with alcohol, to make drinking less miserable.</p>

<p>I read an insightful observation somewhere, maybe in a Gawker comment, that Lindsay Lohan wasn&rsquo;t a cokehead, just an alcoholic who took cocaine to be able to drink more.</p>

<p><strong>Coffee as ideology</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>You&rsquo;re in the city and there&rsquo;s coffee to buy. Either with brunch or after when you walk around the shops. Later there&rsquo;s beer. Someone&rsquo;s in town for a few days or it&rsquo;s a going away party. You drink and talk and make plans to meet at the new brunch place in the morning. They have the best espresso.</p></li>
<li><p>The pass code for the bathroom at the Union Square Starbucks on July 4, 2014 was 8282. And I gave it away to the first person I saw: a Russian tourist standing in line. In turn, she gave it to the people behind her. In this way, she was my first apostle.</p></li>
<li><p>I prefer the discretion of pill poppers and day drunks to the perverts who go to cafes after dark.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Hairy Man</strong></p>

<p>In the March 2014 issue of <em>The Red Bulletin</em>, an interview with Nicolas Cage (“Being Nicolas Cage”) opens with “Do you think about death?” (He does.)</p>

<p>At the grocery store by the energy drinks, there is a sign that says &ldquo;This area is monitored by Closed Circuit Television.&rdquo; In the aisle by the safety razors, the same sign, plus a sliding plastic shield across the shelf&mdash;presumably to slow you down when scooping them into your trash bag.</p>

<p>The implication is that there exists a cohort of congenitally hairy men (or one Hairy Man) who both fiends for caffeine and is willing to do anything to alleviate his condition.</p>
