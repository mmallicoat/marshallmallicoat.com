		</h1>
		<p>The telegraph was an early internet, with its own lolcats and leetspeak. To people in the future, we probly seem like steampunks: one foot in the last century, carrying our brains around in our pockets like Tamagotchis.</p>

<p>To open a file on your computer, you touch an arrowhead to a tiny picture of a manila folder. When you want to save, an artist&rsquo;s rendering of a 3.5” floppy disk. Clicking on a trashcan will de-index a block of memory. If the world was Tetris, we&rsquo;d all have roofs with holes in them (or no roofs at all). </p>

<p>Buddhist prayers wheels have a mantra written around so that, when spun, it is like the mantra is being read. The Dalai Lama has said that having the mantra on your computer works the same as a traditional wheel. As the digital image spins on your hard drive, it sends the peaceful prayer of compassion in all directions.</p>

<p>The Malaysian space agency recommends that Muslim astronauts, if they cannot determine the direction of Mecca, pray in the direction of the Earth. Failing that, any direction is acceptable. Additionally they advise you to &ldquo;observe peace with other beings&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In Tibet and Nepal, they still practice sky burials, where bodies are stripped and laid out for the vultures to eat. But the bodies that have been given medicine or cleaned in hospitals make the vultures sick, so they have to be buried in the ground.</p>

<p>Apparently the most coveted donors for knee replacements are Muslim men. Their patella are kept flexible by the years of praying on their knees.</p>

<p>There have never been middle-aged rappers before. And you can&rsquo;t even make a rapper admit to rapping anymore. They&rsquo;ve become demure. </p>

<p>I remember when pay phones cost 35 cents. I remember pay phones. I asked around and confirmed that they don&rsquo;t even play beer pong with beer in the cups anymore. They just keep score on paper. We will be among the last people on Earth to remember before the Internet, if yet we still do.</p>

			<a href="/2015/01/05/lorraine.html">My brief roommate</a>
		</h1>
		<p>Her name is Lorraine, like the motel where Martin Luther King was shot.</p>

<p>Long tangled hair, grey-brown. Bad teeth. 52 and haggard.</p>

<p>The kind of woman who coughs and hacks and spits in the morning.</p>

<p>Her diet: milk, whitebread, mayonnaise, corn, canned tuna, boiled hotdogs, hamburger buns, instant decaf coffee.</p>

<p>Calls me Marshall or Matthew or Michael and, only once, Raymond.</p>

<p>Frequently offers me food, which I decline.
</br>&#8226; Fruit snacks (“They got Vitamin C.”)
</br>&#8226; Coca-Cola (“It&rsquo;s fresh!”)
</br>&#8226; Crackers (“Whole wheat.”)
</br>&#8226; Chicken giblets (“They&rsquo;re tough. They&rsquo;ll make you strong!”)</p>

<p>Has one of those plastic pill trays with compartments for MORN, NOON, EVE, and BED.</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t have a phone or a computer. The woman who keeps her money was supposed to set her up with a TV and a cellphone but hasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Her friends generally get her attention by standing in front of the building and yelling her name.</p>

<p>In the neighborhood where we live, there are wild roaming chihuahuas.</p>

<p>Used to work sweeping floors, but now no longer works.</p>

<p>Asks me a few times a day for 50 cents, to buy loosies from the corner store. We keep a running tab. I promised myself I wouldn&rsquo;t give her more than $5, but eventually she wore me down. She&rsquo;ll have money for me on the first of the month.</p>

<p>Has a boyfriend, who is apparently French and a carpenter. Sometimes she helps him in some capacity, for which he pays her in McDonald&rsquo;s. He also lets her wash her pissy clothes at his place.</p>

<p>Asked me to buy cocaine for her once, but I said no.</p>

<p>Some things she says:
</br>&#8226; “Oh, yeeaahh?” (face scrunches up like a chipmunk)
</br>&#8226; “Wooow” (breathless awe; can be said after any statement, e.g. <em>L: “Do you have a car?” M: &ldquo;Yeah.” L: “Wooow. What color is it?” M: “Green.” L: “Wooow.”</em>)
</br>&#8226; “Can I borrow fifty cents, baby?”</p>

<p>Is somewhat pleasant to talk to, considering.</p>

<p>Smoked inside the apartment until I told her to stop, then continues to smoke inside when I&rsquo;m not around. Uses a little crystal swan as an ashtray.</p>

<p>Brought a stray cat into the apartment. I made her kick it out, but she still lays out little dishes on the floor for it.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s milk souring somewhere where I can&rsquo;t find.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if she has the cat hidden away somewhere or if she is keeping an imaginary cat.</p>

<p>I have since moved out.</p>

<li><p>People make light of the weird pyramid on the back of the one dollar bill (and the floating Eye above it)&mdash;but they never mention the blighted little shrubs at its foot, or the miasmas rising from the cracked landscape behind.</p></li>
<li><p>You can fold the twenty dollar bill in such a way that the low barberry hedges behind the White House transform into smoke billowing from the World Trade. And a quarter has 119 ridges on the edge [called <em>reeds</em>], which we all know is 9/11 backwards.</p></li>
<li><p>The back of the Susan B. Anthony dollar coin shows a bald eagle clutching a laurel branch, flying above the surface of the moon. But of course there is no air for an eagle to breathe on the moon and no wind to lift his wings.</p></li>
<li><p>It says, <em>This note is legal tender for all debts, public and private.</em> Thus the balance in my bank account means I am owed a great debt.</p></li>
<li><p>At the base of FDR&rsquo;s neck on the dime, there are the initials <em>JS</em> embossed in tiny letters. At one time, people suspected this stood for <em>Joseph Stalin</em>, placed there by a Soviet agent at the mint. They are actually the initials of the designer.</p></li>
<li><p>Samuel Curtis Upham (1819-1885) was a famed counterfeiter of Confederate bills. During the rebellion, he printed millions and sold them for pennies on the dollar. In his lifetime, he was known as Honest Sam Upham.</p></li>
<li><p>One in every ten thousand American bills in circulation is counterfeit. The thing about being covered in cocaine is true. The Confederate dollar was fiat currency 100 years before the US dollar. Your unredeemed Camel Cash expired in 2007 and is worthless.</p></li>
<li><p>Apparently all of the gold ever mined would fill a cube 66 feet by 66 feet by 66 feet.</p></li>
