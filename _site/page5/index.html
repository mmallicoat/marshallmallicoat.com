			<a href="/2015/01/05/lorraine.html">My brief roommate</a>
		</h1>
		<p>Her name is Lorraine, like the motel where Martin Luther King was shot.</p>

<p>Long tangled hair, grey-brown. Bad teeth. 52 and haggard.</p>

<p>The kind of woman who coughs and hacks and spits in the morning.</p>

<p>Her diet: milk, whitebread, mayonnaise, corn, canned tuna, boiled hotdogs, hamburger buns, instant decaf coffee.</p>

<p>Calls me Marshall or Matthew or Michael and, only once, Raymond.</p>

<p>Frequently offers me food, which I decline.
</br>&#8226; Fruit snacks (“They got Vitamin C.”)
</br>&#8226; Coca-Cola (“It&rsquo;s fresh!”)
</br>&#8226; Crackers (“Whole wheat.”)
</br>&#8226; Chicken giblets (“They&rsquo;re tough. They&rsquo;ll make you strong!”)</p>

<p>Has one of those plastic pill trays with compartments for MORN, NOON, EVE, and BED.</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t have a phone or a computer. The woman who keeps her money was supposed to set her up with a TV and a cellphone but hasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Her friends generally get her attention by standing in front of the building and yelling her name.</p>

<p>In the neighborhood where we live, there are wild roaming chihuahuas.</p>

<p>Used to work sweeping floors, but now no longer works.</p>

<p>Asks me a few times a day for 50 cents, to buy loosies from the corner store. We keep a running tab. I promised myself I wouldn&rsquo;t give her more than $5, but eventually she wore me down. She&rsquo;ll have money for me on the first of the month.</p>

<p>Has a boyfriend, who is apparently French and a carpenter. Sometimes she helps him in some capacity, for which he pays her in McDonald&rsquo;s. He also lets her wash her pissy clothes at his place.</p>

<p>Asked me to buy cocaine for her once, but I said no.</p>

<p>Some things she says:
</br>&#8226; “Oh, yeeaahh?” (face scrunches up like a chipmunk)
</br>&#8226; “Wooow” (breathless awe; can be said after any statement, e.g. <em>L: “Do you have a car?” M: &ldquo;Yeah.” L: “Wooow. What color is it?” M: “Green.” L: “Wooow.”</em>)
</br>&#8226; “Can I borrow fifty cents, baby?”</p>

<p>Is somewhat pleasant to talk to, considering.</p>

<p>Smoked inside the apartment until I told her to stop, then continues to smoke inside when I&rsquo;m not around. Uses a little crystal swan as an ashtray.</p>

<p>Brought a stray cat into the apartment. I made her kick it out, but she still lays out little dishes on the floor for it.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s milk souring somewhere where I can&rsquo;t find.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if she has the cat hidden away somewhere or if she is keeping an imaginary cat.</p>

<p>I have since moved out.</p>

<li><p>People make light of the weird pyramid on the back of the one dollar bill (and the floating Eye above it)&mdash;but they never mention the blighted little shrubs at its foot, or the miasmas rising from the cracked landscape behind.</p></li>
<li><p>You can fold the twenty dollar bill in such a way that the low barberry hedges behind the White House transform into smoke billowing from the World Trade. And a quarter has 119 ridges on the edge [called <em>reeds</em>], which we all know is 9/11 backwards.</p></li>
<li><p>The back of the Susan B. Anthony dollar coin shows a bald eagle clutching a laurel branch, flying above the surface of the moon. But of course there is no air for an eagle to breathe on the moon and no wind to lift his wings.</p></li>
<li><p>It says, <em>This note is legal tender for all debts, public and private.</em> Thus the balance in my bank account means I am owed a great debt.</p></li>
<li><p>At the base of FDR&rsquo;s neck on the dime, there are the initials <em>JS</em> embossed in tiny letters. At one time, people suspected this stood for <em>Joseph Stalin</em>, placed there by a Soviet agent at the mint. They are actually the initials of the designer.</p></li>
<li><p>Samuel Curtis Upham (1819-1885) was a famed counterfeiter of Confederate bills. During the rebellion, he printed millions and sold them for pennies on the dollar. In his lifetime, he was known as Honest Sam Upham.</p></li>
<li><p>One in every ten thousand American bills in circulation is counterfeit. The thing about being covered in cocaine is true. The Confederate dollar was fiat currency 100 years before the US dollar. Your unredeemed Camel Cash expired in 2007 and is worthless.</p></li>
<li><p>Apparently all of the gold ever mined would fill a cube 66 feet by 66 feet by 66 feet.</p></li>

<li><p>Never let no one know how much dough you hold<br>

<li><p>Never let them know your next move<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Deny everything</em></p></li>
<li><p>Never trust nobody<br>

<li><p>Never get high on your own supply<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>I want to believe</em></p></li>
<li><p>Never sell no crack where you rest at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Apology is policy</em></p></li>
<li><p>That goddamn credit, dead it<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Everything dies</em></p></li>
<li><p>Never keep no weight on you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>They&rsquo;re watching</em></p></li>
<li><p>If you ain&rsquo;t getting bags, stay the fuck from police<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Believe to understand</em></p></li>
<li><p>A strong word called consignment: strictly for live men, not freshmen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Nothing important happened today</em></p></li>
