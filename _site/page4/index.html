		</h1>
		<p><strong>Cold water after black coffee is like tempering steel</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve come to a calm in the midst of my mid-morning coffee&mdash;my first and only coffee of the day. The fog in my head burns off. The wool-legged spiders who cobweb my attic disperse.</p>

<p>Caffeine doesn&rsquo;t bring euphoria&mdash;more like an elasticity to your limbs and a humming in your head, from the amplified sound of your blood. And a feeling like being wrapped in warm, clean towels.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s only good for the first few sips. Just as you start to enjoy the high, you&rsquo;ve already peaked. By the time you finish, you&rsquo;re past the plateau and down in the valley after.</p>

<p>Nowadays I&rsquo;m only happy for 15 minutes at a time, followed by a headache. And with it comes boredom. Not a boredom like watching paint dry, but watching paint that had recently dried. The grass growing in the lawn has stalled out, and I&rsquo;m languishing in a terminal middle-class lifestyle.</p>

<p><strong>Taking dexedrine at 2am in NYC to hold you thru till 5am when Grand Central re-opens and you can get a train back to Connecticut</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;d say, if caffeine was a taxi conducting your body thru the human traffic, that dexedrine is a black sedan speeding thru a tunnel at night.</p>

<p><strong>Junkie</strong></p>

<p>I can tell when my mom has been drinking coffee. She is jubilant. She is effervescent. She <em>bubbles</em>. I tell her, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me, junkie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She started drinking coffee because she was narcoleptic and would fall asleep while driving. I only started drinking coffee after I started taking caffeine pills. Which I only took with alcohol, to make drinking less miserable.</p>

<p>I read an insightful observation somewhere, maybe in a Gawker comment, that Lindsay Lohan wasn&rsquo;t a cokehead, just an alcoholic who took cocaine to be able to drink more.</p>

<p><strong>Coffee as ideology</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>You&rsquo;re in the city and there&rsquo;s coffee to buy. Either with brunch or after when you walk around the shops. Later there&rsquo;s beer. Someone&rsquo;s in town for a few days or it&rsquo;s a going away party. You drink and talk and make plans to meet at the new brunch place in the morning. They have the best espresso.</p></li>
<li><p>The pass code for the bathroom at the Union Square Starbucks on July 4, 2014 was 8282. And I gave it away to the first person I saw: a Russian tourist standing in line. In turn, she gave it to the people behind her. In this way, she was my first apostle.</p></li>
<li><p>I prefer the discretion of pill poppers and day drunks to the perverts who go to cafes after dark.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Hairy Man</strong></p>

<p>In the March 2014 issue of <em>The Red Bulletin</em>, an interview with Nicolas Cage (“Being Nicolas Cage”) opens with “Do you think about death?” (He does.)</p>

<p>At the grocery store by the energy drinks, there is a sign that says &ldquo;This area is monitored by Closed Circuit Television.&rdquo; In the aisle by the safety razors, the same sign, plus a sliding plastic shield across the shelf&mdash;presumably to slow you down when scooping them into your trash bag.</p>

<p>The implication is that there exists a cohort of congenitally hairy men (or one Hairy Man) who both fiends for caffeine and is willing to do anything to alleviate his condition.</p>

		<p><strong>Istanbul</strong></p>

<p>This last month I went to Istanbul to visit my friend. He&rsquo;s been living there since October. The flight took 10 hours by Turkish Airlines. (They served two meals, which were surprisingly good. They also allow up to two free checked bags. It was not half the sweaty, claustrophobic nightmare ride that it could have been. I would recommend this airline.)</p>

<p>Istanbul is split between Europe and Asia by the Bosphorus strait. I had never been to either continent before. I can tell you Istanbul is cleaner than New York City, with less people begging for money on the street. It&rsquo;s very pretty with the ocean and old buildings, and it&rsquo;s good for walking. I would describe it as European, but again I&rsquo;d never been in Europe.</p>

<p>The food is cheap and the rent is moderate in Usonian terms. The quality of life is HIGH, if not the standard of living. People eat lots of yogurt and drink lots of tea (with sugar cubes). There is a ferry to ride on. Good jackets and dark hair.</p>

<p><strong>More Istanbul</strong></p>

<p>In some places there are so many stray cats that it becomes <em>comical</em>&mdash;like a soft PUNK&#39;ing. The stray dogs are tagged and lie around on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>There are men who pick thru the trash for useful things&mdash;purses, shoes, books, appliances&mdash;and take them around on carts for people to buy, like a moving thrift shop.</p>

<p>They have pay bathrooms in public places. I stole a shit (which would have cost ~$0.40) by tailgating someone who had paid before me.</p>

<p>People drink bottled water there. An anecdote: My Indian landlady came to the US in 2009. At first she couldn&rsquo;t drink the tap water; the taste of the chlorine would make her sick. So she could only drink bottled water.</p>

<p>In public, I like to pretend I&rsquo;m an ethnic white person, Ukrainian or maybe Moldovan, who comes from a hard life of cell phone sales. I don&rsquo;t really act any different. It&rsquo;s mostly how I hold my jaw.</p>

<p><strong>A thinky thing I thot</strong></p>

<p>Everyone was well dressed, tourists from every country on Earth: good leather shoes or sneakers, well fitting pants, nice jackets, smart phones and cameras. Everyone eating at the cafe, shopping for clothes, etc. All wealthy, self-loving consumerists, as vulgar as any American.</p>

<p>No one really gives a shit. Not the European or the Arab or the Asian. Definitely not the Turk selling “selfie sticks” for 300% markup, or the one with blister packs of Viagra outside the Grand Bazaar. You can see foreign men strolling around with blood coming thru the bandages on their scalp, pleased as hell with their new hair plugs.</p>

<p>Travel is a luxury psychedelic, a chance to practice the word for <em>coffee</em> in a new language. The human is happy enough to stay in their home village for their entire life. I might as well never leave the country again.</p>

		<p><strong>Golf</strong></p>

<p>The inner workings of a miniature golf course amount to a secret gospel.</p>

<p>Miniature golf is to golf what reality TV is to reality.</p>

<p>In golf, you swing lowercase L&rsquo;s at the tops of semicolons.</p>

<p>At the bowling alley, they give you golf pencils to keep score.</p>

<p>My grandfather owned both a set of clubs and a bowling ball. My father has neither.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve invented a new drink that&rsquo;s half-Arnold Palmer and half-Shirley Temple, called the LBJ.</p>

<p>Guessing a woman&rsquo;s age is a kind of golf.</p>

<p><strong>Other Sports</strong></p>

<p>Baseball is basically unwatchable, but it works on the radio.</p>

<p>The counter-insurgency is Whac-a-Mole, the drug war Three-card Monte.</p>

<p>Capitalism has wrought the moneyballing of everything. The Dutch work 6 hours a day, then ride bikes home. Americans work for 6 hours, spend 2 hours on Facebook, then crawl thru traffic for 45 minutes.</p>

<p>Someone who sits very still at a desk all day, looking at small numbers on a screen, is a kind of athlete. It takes endurance. You need training and preparation to do it without hurting yourself. These are grown men with all the hair rubbed off their ankles by socks and prostates the size of clenched fists. They will show you their game face.</p>

<p>The highest compliment you can pay a man is to call him a machine. Men strive to make themselves into weapons. This is done thru emotional distance, rituals of control, and repetition.</p>

<p><strong>On Sportsmanship</strong>    </p>

<p>I was a high school wrestler for one day. I was on the swimming team but quit. After failing to induce vomiting in the bathroom, I lied about having vomited to get out of practice. At a strip mall dojo, I put my fist thru the drywall.</p>

<p>In job interviews, I extemporize on my temperament as if I were a race horse. As long as they let me down easy, I don&rsquo;t care if I don&rsquo;t get a call back. To be listed among the also-rans is enough for me. I&rsquo;m like a retired greyhound who&rsquo;s too skinny to lie down on hardwood floors. I understand back pain&ndash;what I lack is <em>context</em> for my back pain.</p>

<p>I saw a picture of the man with the biggest hands in the world, posing with a basketball. But he doesn&rsquo;t even play basketball. He just holds it for photographs. It&rsquo;s like that guy who says he&rsquo;s crazy about football, only he never watches the games, doesn&rsquo;t know the rules, it just pops into his mind every once in a while.</p>
