		<p><strong>Istanbul</strong></p>

<p>This last month I went to Istanbul to visit my friend. He&rsquo;s been living there since October. The flight took 10 hours by Turkish Airlines. (They served two meals, which were surprisingly good. They also allow up to two free checked bags. It was not half the sweaty, claustrophobic nightmare ride that it could have been. I would recommend this airline.)</p>

<p>Istanbul is split between Europe and Asia by the Bosphorus strait. I had never been to either continent before. I can tell you Istanbul is cleaner than New York City, with less people begging for money on the street. It&rsquo;s very pretty with the ocean and old buildings, and it&rsquo;s good for walking. I would describe it as European, but again I&rsquo;d never been in Europe.</p>

<p>The food is cheap and the rent is moderate in Usonian terms. The quality of life is HIGH, if not the standard of living. People eat lots of yogurt and drink lots of tea (with sugar cubes). There is a ferry to ride on. Good jackets and dark hair.</p>

<p><strong>More Istanbul</strong></p>

<p>In some places there are so many stray cats that it becomes <em>comical</em>&mdash;like a soft PUNK&#39;ing. The stray dogs are tagged and lie around on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>There are men who pick thru the trash for useful things&mdash;purses, shoes, books, appliances&mdash;and take them around on carts for people to buy, like a moving thrift shop.</p>

<p>They have pay bathrooms in public places. I stole a shit (which would have cost ~$0.40) by tailgating someone who had paid before me.</p>

<p>People drink bottled water there. An anecdote: My Indian landlady came to the US in 2009. At first she couldn&rsquo;t drink the tap water; the taste of the chlorine would make her sick. So she could only drink bottled water.</p>

<p>In public, I like to pretend I&rsquo;m an ethnic white person, Ukrainian or maybe Moldovan, who comes from a hard life of cell phone sales. I don&rsquo;t really act any different. It&rsquo;s mostly how I hold my jaw.</p>

<p><strong>A thinky thing I thot</strong></p>

<p>Everyone was well dressed, tourists from every country on Earth: good leather shoes or sneakers, well fitting pants, nice jackets, smart phones and cameras. Everyone eating at the cafe, shopping for clothes, etc. All wealthy, self-loving consumerists, as vulgar as any American.</p>

<p>No one really gives a shit. Not the European or the Arab or the Asian. Definitely not the Turk selling “selfie sticks” for 300% markup, or the one with blister packs of Viagra outside the Grand Bazaar. You can see foreign men strolling around with blood coming thru the bandages on their scalp, pleased as hell with their new hair plugs.</p>

<p>Travel is a luxury psychedelic, a chance to practice the word for <em>coffee</em> in a new language. The human is happy enough to stay in their home village for their entire life. I might as well never leave the country again.</p>

		<p><strong>Golf</strong></p>

<p>The inner workings of a miniature golf course amount to a secret gospel.</p>

<p>Miniature golf is to golf what reality TV is to reality.</p>

<p>In golf, you swing lowercase L&rsquo;s at the tops of semicolons.</p>

<p>At the bowling alley, they give you golf pencils to keep score.</p>

<p>My grandfather owned both a set of clubs and a bowling ball. My father has neither.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve invented a new drink that&rsquo;s half-Arnold Palmer and half-Shirley Temple, called the LBJ.</p>

<p>Guessing a woman&rsquo;s age is a kind of golf.</p>

<p><strong>Other Sports</strong></p>

<p>Baseball is basically unwatchable, but it works on the radio.</p>

<p>The counter-insurgency is Whac-a-Mole, the drug war Three-card Monte.</p>

<p>Capitalism has wrought the moneyballing of everything. The Dutch work 6 hours a day, then ride bikes home. Americans work for 6 hours, spend 2 hours on Facebook, then crawl thru traffic for 45 minutes.</p>

<p>Someone who sits very still at a desk all day, looking at small numbers on a screen, is a kind of athlete. It takes endurance. You need training and preparation to do it without hurting yourself. These are grown men with all the hair rubbed off their ankles by socks and prostates the size of clenched fists. They will show you their game face.</p>

<p>The highest compliment you can pay a man is to call him a machine. Men strive to make themselves into weapons. This is done thru emotional distance, rituals of control, and repetition.</p>

<p><strong>On Sportsmanship</strong>    </p>

<p>I was a high school wrestler for one day. I was on the swimming team but quit. After failing to induce vomiting in the bathroom, I lied about having vomited to get out of practice. At a strip mall dojo, I put my fist thru the drywall.</p>

<p>In job interviews, I extemporize on my temperament as if I were a race horse. As long as they let me down easy, I don&rsquo;t care if I don&rsquo;t get a call back. To be listed among the also-rans is enough for me. I&rsquo;m like a retired greyhound who&rsquo;s too skinny to lie down on hardwood floors. I understand back pain&ndash;what I lack is <em>context</em> for my back pain.</p>

<p>I saw a picture of the man with the biggest hands in the world, posing with a basketball. But he doesn&rsquo;t even play basketball. He just holds it for photographs. It&rsquo;s like that guy who says he&rsquo;s crazy about football, only he never watches the games, doesn&rsquo;t know the rules, it just pops into his mind every once in a while.</p>

		<p>The telegraph was an early internet, with its own lolcats and leetspeak. To people in the future, we probly seem like steampunks: one foot in the last century, carrying our brains around in our pockets like Tamagotchis.</p>

<p>To open a file on your computer, you touch an arrowhead to a tiny picture of a manila folder. When you want to save, an artist&rsquo;s rendering of a 3.5” floppy disk. Clicking on a trashcan will de-index a block of memory. If the world was Tetris, we&rsquo;d all have roofs with holes in them (or no roofs at all). </p>

<p>Buddhist prayers wheels have a mantra written around so that, when spun, it is like the mantra is being read. The Dalai Lama has said that having the mantra on your computer works the same as a traditional wheel. As the digital image spins on your hard drive, it sends the peaceful prayer of compassion in all directions.</p>

<p>The Malaysian space agency recommends that Muslim astronauts, if they cannot determine the direction of Mecca, pray in the direction of the Earth. Failing that, any direction is acceptable. Additionally they advise you to &ldquo;observe peace with other beings&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In Tibet and Nepal, they still practice sky burials, where bodies are stripped and laid out for the vultures to eat. But the bodies that have been given medicine or cleaned in hospitals make the vultures sick, so they have to be buried in the ground.</p>

<p>Apparently the most coveted donors for knee replacements are Muslim men. Their patella are kept flexible by the years of praying on their knees.</p>

<p>There have never been middle-aged rappers before. And you can&rsquo;t even make a rapper admit to rapping anymore. They&rsquo;ve become demure. </p>

<p>I remember when pay phones cost 35 cents. I remember pay phones. I asked around and confirmed that they don&rsquo;t even play beer pong with beer in the cups anymore. They just keep score on paper. We will be among the last people on Earth to remember before the Internet, if yet we still do.</p>
