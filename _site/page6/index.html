		<p><strong>Long Vacation</strong></p>

<p>I quit my insurance job for another insurance job in Hartford, Conn. I packed everything I own into the Buick that my grampa left me&mdash;my beautiful big body Buick&mdash;and drove 100 miles deeper into New England.</p>

<p>My stock farewell for exes and departing friends has been, <em>see you later</em>. I like to imagine we will meet again, if the world requires it, if only at the resurrection of the dead. My last day at work didn&rsquo;t feel like anything more than the last day before a long vacation, from which I would inevitably return.</p>

<p><strong>Quebec via Blandford</strong></p>

<p>Between jobs, I went on a road trip to Quebec. I figured Quebec was the closest thing to a foreign country that I could get to for $100. Passing thru Blandford, Mass., I saw a foreboding sign warning of “Low Flying Planes”.</p>

<p>If you found yourself naked on the side of a highway in, say, the Adirondacks, what one item would you want with you? Your cell phone? Your wallet? A gun? Shoes?</p>

<p><strong>Hostel</strong></p>

<p>In French Canada, Starbucks is called Caf&eacute; Starbucks. The detour sign says <em>D&eacute;tour</em>. The deer sign is the same.</p>

<p>The hostel feels like a college dorm. It smells like a college dorm. I slept in a room with five damp Frenchmen. The steam from the attached shower completed our locker room. We mostly laid in the dark and looked at our respective smartphones.</p>

<p>Having quit drinking, there is an empty space in my life, and it&rsquo;s shaped like a pub crawl.</p>

<p><strong>Montreal</strong></p>

<p>I spent the morning at the university library. I walked in the front door and found a seat in the study area. I was questioned by a security guard, but I just pretended to have forgotten my student ID and he relented. There was only one other person there, on a whole floor of long tables and dim cubicles&mdash;and he had probly just come in off the street too.</p>

<p>At a fancy vegan restaurant, I was given a ginger-root beet-juice drink by mistake. I took a sip, knowing it was a mistake, but suppressing this knowledge. I hoped it was somehow complementary or part of the tofu sandwich I had ordered, tho it was nowhere on the menu. The waitstaff discovered their error and suggested I pay for the drink, which I had by then drank. I complied, thinking it couldn&rsquo;t cost that much, and ended up spending 8,95 CAD on some thin red wet.</p>

<p><strong>Montreal 2</strong></p>

<p>Downtown Montreal feels like a clean, depopulated Manhattan.</p>

<p>I stepped into a biblioteque anarchiste just to browse.</p>

<p>This city, like all cities, has been weaponized against transients.</p>

<p><strong>Quebec City</strong></p>

<p>I drove thru a brown landscape that reminded me more of Iowa than France. I was doing 120 in the 100km/h.</p>

<p>The old part of Quebec looks like Europe for someone who has never been to Europe, which I haven&rsquo;t. The facade of the buildings are kept as they were, but inside there are T-shirt shops. It&rsquo;s like Colonial Williamsburg without the pre-diabetic wheelwright going on about the Stamp Act.</p>

<p>I walked in from the rain to a cathedral&mdash;the oldest in America north of Mexico&mdash;and I took off my hat in a gesture of reverence. But it felt ridiculous. Why this reverence? For this so-called House-o-God, built by forced labor, on stolen land, with stone tore up out the ground, and gold leaf by way of Senegal, etc., etc.</p>

<p>In making monuments of the oldest settlements, we venerate scar tissue, while the new wounds still bleed.</p>

<p><strong>Border Crossing</strong></p>

<p>At the border, I propped my door open to talk, since my window won&rsquo;t go down. The guy took the opportunity to shake it back and forth, I suppose to detect hidden contraband. Border guards are always suspicious when you are an American returning to America. (Only now do I wonder about my Fourth Amendment.)</p>

<p>They ask you basic questions like “Where do you live?” but in a pointed way, like they expect anyone other than an upright citizen to be unable to respond. And however commonplace the answer, they take it with exaggerated incredulity. I told him I was on vacation, and he goes “<em>Alone?</em>” with a little grin. I guess they want to rattle you, to see what falls out.</p>

<p>He looked at me hard and then at the row of cars behind and conceded to his gut&rsquo;s calculus. He was disappointed to let me go.</p>

		<p>A mover&rsquo;s joke:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mover: Where&rsquo;s the apartment?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man: It&rsquo;s up on the second floor.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mover: It always is&hellip;</p>

<hr>

<p>A parking ticket citation: &ldquo;This car been seat there to long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A headline I saw: <em>If you read one article on Obamacare today, make it this one.</em></p>

<p>A classified ad: BBW seeks more.</p>

<hr>

<p>Russian joke from the Soviet period:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>[Regarding a man lying in the middle of the street.]</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comrade: His lethargic display of apathy and lack of industry is shameful!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comrade: It is a legitimate response to the harsh and inconsequential nature of being. I celebrate his tenacity!</p>

<hr>

<p>An observation: The weather is not news.</p>

<p>A suspicion: They play horseshoes for money in the park.</p>

<p>MDCCLXXVI: 1776.</p>

<hr>

<p>Logion 72 from the Gospel of Thomas, Lambdin translation:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man said to Jesus: &ldquo;Tell my brothers that they have to divide my father’s possessions with me.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus said to him: &ldquo;Oh man, who has made me a divider?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus turned to his disciples and said to them: &ldquo;I am not a divider, am I?&rdquo;</p>

<hr>

<p>Something you notice: Your workplace has the same faucets as your childhood home.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s more: Parking garages are laid out like a double helix, with pathways in the middle of each level to cross to the other branch.</p>

<p>Neither here nor there: Water tastes better thru a black straw.</p>
