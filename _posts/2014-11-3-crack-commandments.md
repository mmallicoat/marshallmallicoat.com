1. Never let no one know how much dough you hold  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The truth is out there*

2. Never let them know your next move  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Deny everything*

3. Never trust nobody  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Trust no one*

4. Never get high on your own supply  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*I want to believe*

5. Never sell no crack where you rest at  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Apology is policy*

6. That goddamn credit, dead it  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Resist or serve*

7. Keep your family and business completely separated  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Everything dies*

8. Never keep no weight on you  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*They're watching*

9. If you ain't getting bags, stay the fuck from police  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Believe to understand*

10. A strong word called consignment: strictly for live men, not freshmen  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Nothing important happened today*
