# Serif vs. Sans Serif
Using sans serif in headers and serif in posts.
For sub-headings within essays using <strong> instead of <h3> or something.
Maybe need to try to harmonize these.

Title of post is put in .title class, which could be used to differentiate from an <h1> within a post, since the title is also an <h1> but should be bigger/stronger.

Probably shouldn't even use <h3>. First two headings are enough.

# Dates
Probably will show no dates on front page.
Maybe will move dates to *top* of posts.

# Nav Bar
"Feed" is sometimes on left and sometimes on right, but should maybe be consistent.
Is the Archive page used anymore, given that the home page is arranged basically like an archive?
Could maybe remove Archive page, then.
